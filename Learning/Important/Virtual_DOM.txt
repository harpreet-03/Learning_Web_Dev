The Virtual DOM

React builds a representation of the browser Document Object Model or DOM in memory called the virtual DOM. As components are updated, React checks to see if the componentâ€™s HTML code in the virtual DOM matches the browser DOM. If a change is required, the browser DOM is updated. If nothing has changed, then no update is performed.


this is called the reconciliation process.


Step 1: The virtual DOM is updated.

Step 2: The virtual DOM is compared to the previous version of the virtual DOM and checks which elements have changed.

Step 3: The changed elements are updated in the browser DOM.

Step 4: The displayed webpage updates to match the browser DOM.
